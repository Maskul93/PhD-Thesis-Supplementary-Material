	abstract = {Vertical jump performance analysis allows for assessing the ability of the lower limb to generate mechanical power. The analysis performed with inertial measurement units ({IMUs}) is affected by inertial effects of wobbling masses. To compensate for them, an automated method was developed to estimate peak and mean concentric power based on anthropometric and time-frequency features. {IMU} data of 47 countermovement- ({CMJ}) and 50 squat- jumps ({SJ}) performed by 17 participants were used. Force platform data were used to obtain reference power values. Features were chosen according to the best subset regression method, devising a multiple linear regression for each estimated power parameter and jump. The regressions explained 88\% and 96\% variation, for {CMJ} peak and average power respectively, while explaining 75\% and 74\% of the variation for the {SJ}.},
