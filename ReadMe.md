# PhD Thesis Supplementary Material

This repository aims at disseminating what could not be mentioned directly in my PhD thesis.

In this repository you can find some of the procedures I used in my works in the form of codes. All the material here proposed is written in ```MATLAB``` synthax. It can supposedly be used through GNU Octave. The list is the following one:

- [ ] Ankle Functional Calibration (FAN): >aaa<doi: [10.1016/j.jbiomech.2022.111202](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2022.111202)
- [ ] Foot Contacts (ITW): doi: [10.3390/mi14020277](https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14020277)
- [ ] Permutation Feature Importance (PFI): doi: [10.3389/fspor.2023.1112739](https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2023.1112739)
- [ ] Biomechanical Feature Extraction for Countermovement Jumps (CMJ): doi: [10.3389/fspor.2023.1112739](https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2023.1112739)

## Data

Example data are provided in the ```data``` folder. 

All the data comes from real experiments and are supposed to be used for demonstration only. All data are provided as ```.csv``` files, with **dot-separated decimals**.

Each filename prefix refers to the project it shares the acronym with (e.g., ```FAN_FC.csv``` refers to the project involving functional calibration). 

## Otro 

The codes related to other *bigger* portions of the thesis are left to other different repositories, since they had to be made available for publishing purposes. In this case, coding is written both in ```MATLAB``` and ```Python``` (Jupyter Notebook). In particular:

- [ ] Smartphone Height Democratization is available at [height-democratization](https://github.com/Maskul93/height-democratization)
- [ ] Mechanical Power Estimation is available at [Jump-Power-ML-IMU](https://github.com/Maskul93/Jump-Power-ML-IMU)
- [ ] MIMUs Offline Calibration: [MIMU-calib-tutorial](https://github.com/Maskul93/MIMU-calib-tutorial)
