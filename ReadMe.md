# PhD Thesis Supplementary Material

This repository aims at disseminating what could not be mentioned directly in my PhD thesis.

In this repository you can find some of the procedures I used in my works in the form of codes. The list is the following one:

- [ ] Ankle Functional Calibration: 
- [ ] Foot Contacts for ITW: 
- [ ] Permutation Feature Importance:
- [ ] MIMUs Offline Calibration:
- [ ] Biomechanical Feature Extraction for Countermovement Jumps: 

The codes related to other *bigger* portions of the thesis are left to other different repositories, since they had to be made available for publishing purposes. In particular:

- [ ] Smartphone Height Democratization is available at https://github.com/Maskul93/height-democratization
- [ ] Mechanical Power Estimation is available at https://github.com/Maskul93/Jump-Power-ML-IMU
